- On Github.com, navigate to https://github.com/Danish21/wikiMenus
- In the top right corner, click "Fork". You now have your own branch/copy of the repository that you can commit to without messing up the master branch.
- In Git Shell, navigate to C:\xampp\htdocs (or whereever you downloaded xampp to).
- In Git Shell, type "git clone https://github.com/[your username]/wikiMenus". You now have a local copy of your branch on your computer.

    3. On the right side, under "Clone Path", change the path in that input field to C:\xampp\htdocs\wikimenus, or whereever you have the wikimenus folder.
- IMPORTANT: every time before you start working, you need to do "git pull upstream master" to get the most up-to-date version of the origin branch, with all your team members' approved changes to it. If you have outstanding commits in your branch, this may throw an error. In this case, do a commit-and-pull-request or "git stash" (throw away) your changes.
- After making a change to your local copy, you can commit it to your own branch by doing: 
	1. git add .
	2. git commit -m "changed stuff"
	3. git push
	4. go to your own branch on the github website, click the green button to make a pull request so that others may review/approve/deny your changes.
- Every time before you start working, you need to commit or "stash" (throw away) your changes, then sync your branch with the origin branch in order to get the most up-to-date changes that everyone else made. To do this, type "git pull upstream master"

	4. go to https://github.com/[your username]/wikiMenus, click the green button at the top left of the page to make a pull request so that others may review/approve/deny your changes before merging onto danish's branch.
